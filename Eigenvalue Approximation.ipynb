    "# Numerically Solving Various Potential Functions applied to the Quantum Particle in a Box via the Shooting Method\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding analytical solutions to the Schrödinger equation can become impractical for complex systems, such as asymmetric quantum wells used to model electrons in semiconductors or molecules with multiple interacting charged particles. Solutions are found by solving the Time-Independent Schrodinger Equation (TISE); the general TISE is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\hat{H}\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = E\\,\\psi(\\mathbf{r})\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, which depends on the physical system (e.g. single-particle systems are simpler than molecular wavefunctions), $\\psi(\\mathbf{r})$ is the wavefunction of the quantum system in three dimensions, and  $E$ is the eigen energies of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make problems analytically tractable, simplifying assumptions are introduced, such as the Born-Oppenheimer approximation (Rae & Napolitano, 2016), which separates electronic and nuclear motion in molecules. However, in many cases, numerical methods are necessary - which is the focus of this study.\n",
    "\n",
    "A one-dimensional infinite potential well, which serves as a simple model for quantum dots is considered in the investigation. Quantum dots are nanometer-scale semiconductor structures that confine electrons, leading to discrete energy levels (McMillan, Batrakova & Gendelman, 2011). When an electron transitions between these levels, it emits photons of narrow spectral width (i.e. a very pure colour), thus making quantum dots valuable for applications in commercial use cases such as displays (Li et al., 2024) and medical imaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Schrodinger Equation for a single particle in one-dimension is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 \\psi(x)}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} + V(x)\\,\\psi(x) = E\\,\\psi(x) \n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hbar$ is Planck's Constant divided by $2\\pi$, $m$ is the mass of the particle, $V(x)$ is the potential energy function within the well, and $\\psi(x)$ is the wavefunction in one dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study applies the Shooting Method to solve the TISE for various potential functions (four in total), which combines the Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method for initial-value problems and the Secant Method for root-finding (to satisfy boundary conditions).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method\n",
    "### Shooting Method\n",
    "The Shooting Method is a numerical approach used to solve boundary value problems (BVP) (Newman, 2013). Here, it is applied to enforce the boundary conditions of the electron wavefunction inside the potential well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta Method\n",
    "\n",
    "RK4 is a numerical integration technique for solving initial value problems involving systems of first-order differential equations. The Schrödinger equation can be rewritten as two first-order differential equations:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\psi}{dt} &= \\phi = f(\\psi), \\\\ \n",
    "\\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\phi}{dt} &= \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\left [V(x) - E \\right]\\psi(x) = f(\\phi) \\\\\n",
    "\\implies \\mathbf{f} = \\begin{pmatrix} \n",
    "f_{\\psi} \\\\ \n",
    "f_{\\phi}\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix} &= \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "\\phi \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\left [V(x) - E \\right]\\psi(x)\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "RK4 is utilised to compute $\\psi(x)$ numerically, starting from an initial condition where the wavefunction is zero at one boundary. The initial choice of $\\psi(x)$ affects the amplitude and sign of the wavefunction (of lesser importance since the wavefunction will be normalised).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Secant Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The Secant Method is an iterative algorithm used to find the eigen energies that satisfy the boundary conditions. In the infinite square well, the wavefunction must be zero at both boundaries. The problem of finding energy eigenvalues can therefore be transmuted into a root-finding problem, where we search for values of $E$ that ensure:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\psi_{x=d/2}(E) = 0\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\psi_{x=d/2}(E)$ is the final point of the wavefunction as a function of energy, $E$, and the energies which satisfy (6) are the eigen energies of the TISE.\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply the Secant Method, two initial energy estimates are required. If these estimates are too far from the actual eigenvalues, the method may either fail to converge or find an excited-state energy instead of the ground state. "

    "## Efficiently Estimating a Guess Energy\n",
    "In numerical approaches, estimating the correct eigen energies is crucial for solving the Schrodinger equation accurately. To approximate these eigenvalues, how the wavefunction behaves at the boundary as energy varies should be first investigated. Specifically, by plotting the final value of $\\psi_{\\mathrm{final}}(x)$ as a function of energy, we can identify points where $\\psi(x)$ approaches zero, indicating possible eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function may be implemented to systematically scan a specified energy range, evaluating the final value of $\\psi(x)$ at each step. Energy values that bring $\\psi(x)$ close to zero are recorded as initial ansatz guesses for the Secant Method. However, since this function iterates over discrete energy values and calls the Runge-Kutta Method (which involves a loop), the computational complexity scales as $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. To reduce runtime, fewer discrete energy points must be used, trading off accuracy for efficiency in the initial estimation. By using this approach with numerical solvers, the desired wavefunctions and eigen energies may be determined accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function implemented specifically considers whether there is a change in sign between two points (i.e. where the function crosses the x-axis), and returns one of the two energy values at which this sign change occurs. It is noted, however, that the sign need not flip for the final point of the wavefunction to be zero (i.e. minima/maxima could occur, which still are eigen energies). Furthermore, discontinuities would also result in a sign change, though these energies are not eigen energies. Thus, this implemented function is not general, and new functions should be synthesised depending on the behaviour of the function."

    "As the energy state of the electron grows, so does the difference in wavefunction behaviour of the embedded and regular case. Firstly, noticeable difference between eigen energies is seen in the corresponding potential plot on the right. Secondly, as the wavefunction of the regular harmonic potential reaches the boundaries of the well, the value of the wavefunction is still well above zero. Furthermore, the amplitude of the numerical wavefunction of the embedded potential is noticeably greater than the analytic wavefunction of the regular potential; since the probability density of the embedded case is forced to be equal to one within the well, while not so for the regular case (performing a numerical integration, a probability of ~0.9796 was obtained for the regular harmonic wavefunction, suggesting an extra ~0.02 to be accounted for outside the well), which is expected; this confinement of the electron to a finite limit also raises the energy of the electron - since in the regular case, the electron is more spread out over space, its wavelength is longer, thus leading to a lower energy in the regular case."

    "Plotting $f_{\\rm{tan}}$ and  $f_{\\rm{cot}}$ as a function of energy allows complete comprehension of how the function behaves regarding discontinuities and roots. The discontinuities in the plot result in a sign change, and thus, due to the nature of the method employed, will return the energies close to the discontinuities although they are not eigen energies.\n",
    "\n",
    "To combat this issue, a new function is defined which excludes these discontinuities, and only accounts for smooth transitions above and below the x-axis. A key observation is that the y values near discontinuities are extremely large (reaching a few hundred to a few thousand to a few hundred thousand); furthermore the points near the x-axis are near zero, as seen in the graph on the right hand side. Thus, this knowledge may be implemented to extract only the root energies and not the discontinuities."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The infinite square well was used to model a quantum dot with an electron confined within. A total of four potential functions was embedded within the infinite well - the zero potential, harmonic potential, finite square potential, and the double well potential were solved for numerically via the Shooting Method and analytically (where possible). A method was devised (which varies depending on the potential considered) to procure eigen energy guesses to  be passed as input in the Secant Method to ensure convergence to the desired eigen state. Using this method, low lying excited states and higher excited bound states were considered in all cases, and compared to their analytic solutions (where possible); discrepancies between the analytic and numerical solutions were explored and discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "First backtesting our numerical results with the zero potential function, it was found that our numerical method was reliable and could be applied to non-trivial cases. The harmonic potential yielded that low lying excited states could be approximated very well with the embedded harmonic potential, only displaying significant deviation in highly excited states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, in the embedded finite well, choosing a relatively narrow finite well width ensured that most of the wavefunction of the analytic solution remained in the infinite well boundaries. Thus, the numerical embedded finite well solution did not deviate too far from the analytic case, even in highly excited states. This meant that for a narrow finite well width, the numerical solution could approximate the analytic case for most energy states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the Shooting Method was applied to the embedded double well potential. The behaviour of the numerical wavefunction at low lying energy levels and the highest excited state was considered, and potential applications were discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the embedded cases of the regular potentials aptly approximated the regular potentials for low lying excited states, and in some cases, even highly excited states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Work\n",
    "\n",
    "In extensions of this investigation, other numerical methods could be explored; the variational method utilising the Variational Principle could be considered in numerically solving wavefunctions (Tiernan8r, 2020). Furthermore, extensions of the same potentials to two or three dimensions could be considered for a more realistic model."
